Earlier the process for selection of employees involved a series of training and evaluation programs, whose performance scores were later sent to HQ team for further discussion which delayed the whole process to some extent.

                    Now, due to time and resource constraints, Current CEO has looked up this situation and has asked your help to optimise it using your Data Science Background.</p>
